## My portfolio 
Since I consider myself to be React developer (at least to certain degree) I decided to create portfolio in React.JS. 
Because at the moment I have a job, this portfolio is more for exercise purposes and to keep in one my places my favourite projects together (although I hope that in close future I will be able to have more interesting projects to show off). 

Here are some screenshots of how portfolio looks like:

I think regarding the overall aesthetics I could a bit more input to it, but during lockdown my creativity levels are shamefully low.

          <h1>Hi, I'am Adrianna, a software engineer for BBC Scotland.</h1>
        </div>

          <p>
            I work as a full-stack software engineer for BBC Archive Services. I
            am both interested in frontend and backend technologies. I really
            like building web-apps with React, games in Unity Engine and
            learning new programming languages and concepts. I am a bit of a
            data geek and I like reading about AI and Data Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            My interests are focused on impact of technology on people's
            everyday life and how technology can improve things.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside that, I like learning about history of the world, write and
            read books, doing yoga (when I don't feel lazy)travel and cook.
            During lockdown I started an online book club in Edinburgh, and I
            joined few other book clubs as well.
